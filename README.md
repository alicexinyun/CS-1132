Transition to MATLAB (Spring 2016): This repository includes selected exercises and assignments from the online modules of an auto-tutorial course taught by Dr. Daisy Fan. Some of the code skeleton is provided in the modules, not written by me. Assignments seem to change (a lot) every semester so I decided to make my code public. I did not officially take the class but learned the material on my own. If you spot any error or want to discuss with me about anything related to this repository, please do not hesitate to email me at xc278 at cornell dot edu.
